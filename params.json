{"name":"Java Logo","tagline":"Logo for all computers","body":"Home\r\n====\r\n\r\nLogo was originally designed in 1967 Daniel G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon.\r\nIt is now well know for begging the 'turtle' programming language. The only problem with Logo is that\r\nas it is under the public domain, every version is slightly different, so if you download a version for\r\nmac and then a version for windows, you will get different versions that run differently. We have the solution. Java logo can run on any kind of computer that runs java and with help from @louisdw1, I have created a version of the brilliant logo program.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
